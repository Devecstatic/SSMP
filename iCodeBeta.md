# iCode for iOS
*Multi-Language IDE for iOS*

## What is iCode?
Project iCode is is a multi-language IDE built for iPad. It compiles remotely and can edit Xcode, Visual Studio, and website projects.

## How does it compile?
ðŸ¤« Its a secret. Sign up for beta to find out.

## Will it be open sourced?
No, this is a private project that will be in public beta soon.

## What about other platforms?
iCode is the codename for the iOS version. The final version will support iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux, and Web.

## Will it have any proprietary files?
iCode will have its own project file: .icproj

It is a type of JSON file that has all of the projects code and directories in one file rather than a directory. The file is encrypted and compressed for the most secure code. It would also bring down the average project size.

The clients will have the ability to convert a project file into different type of projects depending on the project. For example, an iOS application would be able to convert to an Xcode project. A cross-platform mobile application would convert to a Visual Studio solution.

## Where can I get it?
Public beta will be released shortly. If you'd like to get an invite when its out, email ethanlipnik@gmail.com regarding iCode Beta.
